# Architecture Documentation Rule

When creating or updating architecture documentation (e.g., ARCHITECTURE.md as a project map):

- Prioritize high-level overview: Use diagrams (Mermaid) for layers, modules, and patterns – avoid code details.
- Follow SOLID and Gang of Four: Emphasize separation of concerns (e.g., Repository Pattern for data access, SRP for services).
- Structure as a map: Include sections like high-level diagram, key patterns, module table with responsibilities.
- Keep compact: 1-2 pages, visual over text; link to code/details for depth.
- Update on changes: Review after refactors; ensure new devs can grasp structure quickly without reading all code.
- Reference existing docs: Link to ERROR_HANDLING.md for patterns; use Markdown + Mermaid for portability.
